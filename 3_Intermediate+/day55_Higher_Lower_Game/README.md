# Higher Lower Game with Flask

- Create a new Flask application where the home route displays "Guess a number between 0 and 9"

- Generate a random number between 0 and 9

- Create a route that can detect the number entered by the user e.g "URL/3" or "URL/9" 
  and checks that number against the generated random number.
  
- If the number is too low, tell the user it's too low, same with too high or if they found the correct number.
