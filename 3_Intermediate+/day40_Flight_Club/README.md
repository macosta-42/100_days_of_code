- Use the Flight Search API to check for the cheapest flights 
    from tomorrow to 6 months later for all the cities in the Google Sheet
  

- Generate a Google Flight link with all the information pre-populated
    so that users can book the flights by clicking on the link in the email
  

- If the price is lower than the lowest price listed in the Google Sheet 
    then send an Email via SMTP to all users included in the users Google Sheet
  

- The Email includes the departure airport IATA code, destination airport IATA code, 
    departure city, destination city, flight price and flight dates. e.g.
    and the Google flight link for the user to book the flights by clicking on the link
